## **About me**

Hello, i am passionate about data with knowledge of Python, Power Bi, machine learning, SQL and other tools for data processing and visualization.

Before becoming into data analyst, I completed my PhD in chemical engineering. At this time I gained many skills in terms of research, data collection, data processing, visualization and presentation of results. In addition, i published different articles in scientific journals and presented my research work at different scientific congress.

My goal is to exploit my knowledge in data, as well as continue learning new IT skills, driven by enthusiasm and effort.
